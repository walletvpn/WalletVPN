# ðŸ”¶ AI Integration with WVPN

_Processing data in untrusted environments and sharing and analyzing multi-party data have become critical items for an organization's success. Rather than taking a fuzzy approach, the increasing complexity of data analytics engines and architectures requires vendors to incorporate a privacy by design feature._

_The diffusion of Artificial Intelligence models and the need to train them is just the latest addition to privacy concerns, adds the consultancy, which predicts: the average annual budget of large companies for data privacy will exceed US$2.5 million by 2024, mainly because of adjustments and implementations of technological trends related to the sector._

_Unlike common unused data security controls, privacy-enhanced computing (PEC) protects data in use. As a result, organizations can implement data processing and analysis that was previously impossible due to privacy or security issues._

_40% of organizations have had an Artificial Intelligence privacy breach and that of those breaches, only one in four were malicious. Whether organizations process personal data through an Artificial Intelligence-based module integrated into a vendor offering or through a discrete platform managed by an internal data science team, the privacy risks and potential misuse of personal data are clear._

_We will have an artificial intelligence system monitoring all transactions in our multi-chain network, with this process we will be able to obtain statistical data of operations and guarantee our investors safety, we will bring investors security, less bureaucracy for the creation of wallets through the TOR network and also non-custodial issues, freeing and exempting investors from abusive and exploitative fees. With this Once AI regulation becomes more established, it will be nearly impossible to uncover the toxic data ingested in the absence of an Artificial Intelligence governance program._
