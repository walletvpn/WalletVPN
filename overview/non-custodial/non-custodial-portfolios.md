# â–« non-custodial portfolios

Now we understand what a custodial wallet is, and its main pros and cons, what about non-custodial wallets? **This is a type of wallet where the owner of the cryptocurrency takes direct responsibility for managing its keys.**

This means that if the owner somehow loses/lost the keys, the cryptocurrency in the wallet could be lost forever. As noted earlier, they can come in the form of web browser-based software, common downloadable software, hardware, or in paper form. **Hardware wallets are widely seen as the most secure way to store cryptocurrency wallet keys.**

#### Pros of the Custodyless Wallet&#x20;

As cryptocurrency purists who seek to completely throw off the yoke of government/centralized financial institutions argue, **custodless wallets give investors complete control over their assets.** When stored in a non-custodial wallet, no centralized entity can confiscate or freeze a digital asset.

With custodless wallets, there is no barrier to participation in the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Anyone with an Internet connection anywhere in the world can set up a wallet without facing KYC restrictions.

Another benefit of custodeless **wallets is that it is easier to engage in digital asset transfers because they interact directly with the blockchain.** This means that custodeless wallets, unlike their custodial counterparts, in many cases have direct access to the growing **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem.**
