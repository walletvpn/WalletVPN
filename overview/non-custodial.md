# Non Custodial

One of the first conundrums faced by cryptocurrency beginners is the wallet , a place where all digital assets are **"stored"**. Technically speaking, unlike money in a physical wallet, cryptoassets do not reside inside a digital asset wallet. Understanding cryptocurrency wallets is therefore a prerequisite for anyone who wants to participate in the rapidly growing **decentralized cryptocurrency-based financial system.**

#### Every cryptocurrency wallet has two main components:

* **Public key:** If you want to send cryptocurrencies to someone, you will need to know their public key and vice versa.&#x20;
* **Private key:** The private key, as the name suggests, must be kept secret/private by the wallet owner. A wallet owner needs to sign off on any transaction that moves digital assets from a wallet using the private keys.

**Wallet keys can be stored on the Internet or on your computer via the wallet software.** The keys can also be printed/written on paper or stored on a hardware device. As a result, cryptocurrency wallets can take different forms.

#### Custody portfolio

Before diving into the discussion of the different physical/software forms a digital wallet can take, it is important to understand the difference between custodial and non-custodial wallets.

The former is essentially where a cryptocurrency investor entrusts a third party with the management/protection of their wallet keys. This third party takes on the role of **"custodian,"** tasking them with preserving the cryptocurrency owners' property.
