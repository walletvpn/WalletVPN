# â–« Tor (anonymity network)

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">History</mark>

Tor is a program that protects the identity and privacy of its users while they are online on the Internet. The name Tor comes from the initials of a project called "The Onion Router" and was the brainchild of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. This project was supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which is one of the best known Internet rights organizations in the world. It is open source software and is constantly associated with the Deep Web, which is the part of the Internet of unindexed suspicious content.

Tor was conceived in September 2002 and is designed to make it possible for countless people to remain anonymous on the Internet from its C programming language, which allows this. Lately it has gained thousands of new users from all over the world interested in keeping their information secure.

When you have Tor installed on your computer, it hides your identity on the network and prevents anyone interested from viewing your tasks. This happens thanks to a complex mechanism that uses a data transmission network that passes through numerous machines.

#### For example:

When you send a message to someone, that message has to pass not just one, but several PCs before it reaches the recipient. This process makes it difficult to access a specific computer and confuses third parties who are interested in invading your privacy and violating your information.

In addition to confusing malicious third parties through the complex scheme of the network of machines, Tor is also capable of masking your IP addresses and blocking hacker attempts to access your PC.

There is one more very useful advantage to using Tor, and that is that you can hide your location. Tor does not allow web pages to access the personal information of their users. It already blocks them before you ask.

Tor is undoubtedly a competent program to hinder and prevent criminals from accessing your data, but nothing on the Internet is 100% safe. It hides your IP and your location in order to keep your identity anonymous, but you need to know that the best solution is still to combine prevention and education. So there is no point in staying hidden on the Internet while surfing recklessly. So make sure you use strong passwords, two-step verification of your accounts, do not shop at unknown sites, etc.
