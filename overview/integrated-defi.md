# ðŸ”¸ Integrated DeFi

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">DeFi Introduction</mark>

DeFi or Decentralized Finance is the name that is defining a major trend that is occurring around blockchain technology in recent years.DeFi seeks to develop small traditional financial pieces, but with an extra degree of transparency and decentralization. These small pieces, like Lego pieces, can be combined with each other to develop a whole ecosystem of small solutions that together form a great solution for finance that invalidates the need for centralized and opaque financial institutions that no longer add value.

This is the idea that drove the creation of the term "DeFi", and the one that has led its evolution to the current point. In fact, it is currently impossible to ignore the huge impact that DeFi has on the crypto world. That's why we've opened a space to learn what DeFi is and how this idea is changing the global financial world.

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">DeFi Characteristics</mark>

1. **They work based on blockchain and smart contract technology.**&#x20;
2. **They are very secure**. This is because they use powerful cryptographic techniques to ensure that the platform, access and use can only be carried out by authorized people.&#x20;
3. **They have high levels of decentralization**. The greatest potential of DeFi is their high levels of decentralization. That is, they have the ability to act without the need for a bureaucratic chain to impose itself on the functions of the platform.&#x20;
4. **No reliance on third parties.** This means that acting on a platform is direct between the user and the platform itself. Trusted third parties are unnecessary because this task will be performed by the blockchain. It is this structure that will keep track of everything securely and immutably.&#x20;
5. **Transparent**.  Another great feature of DeFi is its transparency. Since they are built on open source software, every line of code in the platforms is auditable. In addition, resource mobilizations are auditable because they all take place on the blockchain.&#x20;
6. **Borderless**. Access to a DeFi platform has no borders. You can be in any country in the world and access its services without inconvenience.

* **It allows access to financial services for millions of people without a bank account.** This is, without a doubt, a golden opportunity to bring development and financial freedom to those who for different reasons have not been able to enjoy these services.&#x20;
* **It allows the international financing of companies and projects to be much simpler.** DeFi platforms can be tailored to the needs of a target audience, in order to bring development and investment where it is needed. And those investments can come from anywhere in the world securely.&#x20;
* **It creates a new point of diversification and economic development.** In fact, DeFi can mean a major economic development point in the medium term because of the huge economic potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
